## Summary
I am a Principal Software Engineer and Architect with 20+ years of experience designing and owning petabyte-scale, event-driven, distributed systems in highly regulated environments (banking, fintech, government, etc.). I architect and govern Kafka-based platforms, managing data volumes up to 1.2 Billion messages and processing over 100M events per day, where correctness, auditability, and operational resilience are non-negotiable

I specialize in Kafka-based streaming platforms, cloud-native architectures, and deterministic, replayable systems. In my current role, I provide senior technical leadership for integrating PNC’s enterprise data streaming platform with Zafin, enabling scalable, policy-driven processing while preserving strict governance and consistency guarantees. I routinely serve as the final technical authority on streaming architecture, data contracts, and system-level integration decisions.

My work sits at the intersection of architecture, execution, and risk management. I align business objectives with system design, ensuring microservices and streaming technologies are applied pragmatically—as enablers of measurable outcomes, not trends.

In parallel, I design and explore governed AI integration within event-driven systems through independent research and open-source work. My focus is on architectures where LLMs and agentic workflows operate within deterministic pipelines, with explicit audit trails, replay safety, and a clear separation between facts, decisions, and actions.

## How I think about architecture
- **Kafka is the system of record** for events; services derive state, they don’t rewrite facts.
- **Governance scales better than heroics:** schemas, contracts, ownership, and operational discipline.
- **Determinism matters:** idempotency, replay safety, and traceability are design requirements.
- **Observability is part of correctness:** logging, metrics, and clear failure modes.
- **AI must be governed:** constrain decisioning and keep auditable separation between facts, decisions, and actions.

## Selected work
- **Agentic Kafka Reference Architecture (flagship)** — governed GenAI inside deterministic, event-driven pipelines  
  A production-style reference architecture showing how LLM/agent workflows operate **within replayable Kafka systems**, preserving auditability, determinism, and a strict separation between facts, decisions, and actions.
